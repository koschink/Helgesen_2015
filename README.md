# Helgesen_2015
A script to measure distances of replication foci in E.coli using ImageJ and Python.

This script perfomes automatic measurements of the distance between neighboring spots that are registered in two different fluorescence channels. The script runs as Jython plugin under Fiji and uses ‘Find Maxima’ as a tool for spot/focus detection within the specimen. The measured distances were also used to estimate the level of colocalization (object-based colocalization). The script was evaluated by analysis of fluorescently labeled TetraSpeck beads and cells with fluorescently tagged replisome proteins (SSB and HolC).
